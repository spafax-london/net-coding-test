### Task 1

Create a function which counts the number of occurrences of a given letter in a string.

Example:
Input: <pre>'e' and "I have some cheese"</pre>
Output: <pre>**5**</pre>

---

### Task 2

Create a function which says if a string is a palindrome.

Output: <pre>**False**</pre>

Input: <pre>God saved Evaâ€™s dog</pre>
Output: <pre>**True**</pre>

### Task 3

#### Part A)

Create a function which counts the number of occurrences of words from a "censored words list" in a text.

Example:
Input: <pre>{"dog", "cat", "large"} and "I have a cat named Meow and a dog name Woof. I love the dog a lot. He is larger than a small horse."</pre>
Output: <pre>**cat: 1, dog: 2, large: 1, total: 4**</pre>

#### Part B)

Create a way to censor words featured in the "censored words list" that appear in the text.

Example:
Input: {"moew", "woof"} and "I have a cat named Meow and a dog name Woof. I love the dog a lot. He is larger than a small horse."
Output: "I have a cat named M$$w and a dog name W$$f. I love the dog a lot. He is larger than a small horse."

#### Part C)

Create a way to censor a single word palindrome in a text.

Example
Input: "Anna went to vote in the election to fulfil her civic duty"
Output: "A$$a went to vote in the election to fulfil her c$$$c duty"

#### Part D - BONUS)

Come up with at least 3 different ways to load the "censored words list" in the application.
